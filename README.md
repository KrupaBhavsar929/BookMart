# Installation

Before installing the project, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python (3.11.3 recommended)
- pip (Python package installer)

# Setting up the environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage the dependencies and keep them separate from other projects. Hereâ€™s how you can set up a virtual environment:

# Install virtualenv if it's not installed
pip install virtualenv

# Create a virtual environment

virtualenv venv

# Activate the virtual environment

# On Windows

venv\Scripts\activate

# On MacOS/Linux

source venv/bin/activate

# Installing dependencies

Once your environment is ready, you can install the required Python packages using pip:

# Navigate to the project directory

cd path/to/bookmart

# Install Django and other dependencies from the requirements file

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Setting up the database

This project uses SQLite, which is Django's default database. You will need to set up the initial database and run migrations as follows:

# Run migrations to create the database schema

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

# Running the server

Now you're ready to run the development server and see the project in action:

# Run the Django development server

python manage.py runserver

# Accessing the Application

Once the server is running, you can access different parts of the application using the following URLs:

# Home Page
